React App for displaying the available food trucks near your locations

Enter the lat-long of your location to get the map area near your location.
Entering the location name and getting the respective map feature could be integrated later on, as this is only a demo so lat and long feature is used.

I had the idea of creating a backend using express js where the user would be able to filter trucks using respective REST apis but due to shortage of time I thought this to be the best solution.

Thank you
Happy trucking :)
